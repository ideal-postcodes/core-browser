# Webpack Example

## Use in your app

### Install

Using the `-bundled` version is simplest for webpack, as this ships the pre-transpiled version of core-browser.

```bash
npm install --save @ideal-postcodes/core-browser-bundled
```

### Usage

```javascript
import { Client } from "@ideal-postcodes/core-browser-bundled";
```

## Run this demo

```bash
npm install && npm run build && npm start
```
